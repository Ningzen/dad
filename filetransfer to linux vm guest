#Does my host pc have winscp??

sudo yum -y install openssh-server openssh-clients

#Starting SSH Service
sudo systemctl start sshd

#Check sshd status
sudo systemctl status sshd

#stop ssh daemon
systemctl stop sshd

#Enable SSH to start automatically after each system reboot by using the systemctl command:
sudo systemctl enable sshd

#Properly configuring the sshd configuration file hardens server security 
#The most common settings to enhance security are changing the port number, disabling root logins, and limiting access to only certain users.

#To edit these settings access the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

#then
service sshd restart

#It is also possible to restrict IP access to make the connection even more secure.

#To restrict IP access, edit the iptables file by typing:
sudo vim /etc/sysconfig/iptables

#To allow access using the port defined in the sshd config file, add the following line to the iptables file:
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 2002 -j ACCEPT

#To restrict access to a specific IP, for example 133.123.40.166, edit the line as follows:
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -s 133.123.40.166 -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 2002 -j ACCEPT

#Restart iptables to apply the changes:
sudo systemctl restart iptables
