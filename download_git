 sudo yum --disablerepo=* localinstall foo.rpm bar.rpm baz.rpm
Since you have downloaded all the dependencies to a single directory, you can also use rpm to install those:

 sudo rpm -Uvh *.rpm
sudo rpm -ivh *.rpm

//check all the dependencies else all will fail
sudo rpm -V *.rpm

//broken
yum deplist docker-ce

sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Configure firewall
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp --add-port=443/tcp --add-port=2222/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

To pull all the dependencies and put them into one package using YUM on a Linux system, you can use the yum-plugin-tmprepo package to create a temporary repository containing all the dependencies, and then use the yumdownloader command to download the packages to a directory, which can then be used to create a new package.

Here are the steps to follow:

Install the yum-plugin-tmprepo package:

Copy code
sudo yum install yum-plugin-tmprepo
Create a temporary repository containing all the dependencies:

css
Copy code
sudo yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=/tmp/mydeps mypackage
sudo yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=/tmp/mydeps --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=tmprepo $(repoquery --requires --resolve mypackage)
sudo createrepo /tmp/mydeps
This will create a repository in the /tmp/mydeps directory that contains all the dependencies for mypackage.

Use yumdownloader to download the packages to a directory:

javascript
Copy code
sudo yum install yum-utils
sudo yumdownloader --destdir=/tmp/mypackage --resolve mypackage
This will download mypackage and all its dependencies to the /tmp/mypackage directory.

Create a new package using the downloaded packages:

bash
Copy code
sudo yum install rpm-build
rpmbuild --rebuild /tmp/mypackage/mypackage*.src.rpm
This will create a new package that contains mypackage and all its dependencies.

Install the new package:

bash
Copy code
sudo yum install /root/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/mypackage*.rpm
This will install the new package containing mypackage and all its dependencies.
